* Quantum effect 

In quantum world there exist effects that are unseen in non-quantum.
It's the same in quantum checkers -- some positions that are impossible
in classical checkers are commodity here. One of the simplest effects
is the possibility for pieces of different colors to be in the same
cell. With some probability, of course. Consider this position

B - B - B
- - - - -
- - W - -

In the above example let's check what happens if middle back piece
moves and then the white one does.

B - B - B      B - - - B
- - - - -  ->  - b - b -
- - W - -      - - W - -

First, the black piece turns into the superposition-ed state.

B - - - B      B - - - B
- b - b -  ->  - x - x -
- - W - -      - - - - -

Next the white piece moves and, as it cannot capture none of the
new middle black positions, it stepts into the same cells. And in
cells marked with 'x'-s we have both -- black and white pieces
tigether.

Of course, this is probabilistic, once we measure either cell we
immediatelly find out in which cell which piece is, but before it
we should admit that both cells contain pieces of both colors.
