* Entanglement

One of the interesting effects in quantum mechanics is
entanglement effect. It says that sometimes the state of
two or more particles depends on each other in a way, that
measuring the state of one particle immediately gives you
the state of another, which, in non-entangled situation,
you wouldn't know and would have to measure separately.

In QC pieces can be entangled too, let's see one example
of how this can happen.

- B - - - -     - - - - - -
- - - - - -  -> b - b - - -
- - - W - -     - - - W - -

B moved and happened in two cells with probability 1/2.
Now it's W move. It can either capture B on the right
cell ir just step into it if B is really on the left.

- w - - - -
b - w - - -
- - - - - -

Now we can try to measure the cell in which B can be.
Not, that there's neither white piece in this cell NOR
it has ever been there. If we measure this cell two
results are possible

- - - - - -    - W - - - -
B - W - - - OR - - - - - -
- - - - - -    - - - - - -

We've found out the B state -- it's either dead or alive.
But at the same time, without really messing with it,
we've also found out the position of the white piece. Now
we know where it is.
