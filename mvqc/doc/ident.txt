* Indistinguishable pieces

In quantum checkers pieces cannot be told from one another as if
they were electrons or any other quantum particles. Look at this

- - - - -
- - W - W
- - - W -

First white move with top-left piece which turns into a superposition.
When white move again they move with lower piece. This time this
move is not quantum as this piece cannot move up-right.

- w - w -      - w - w -
- - - - W  ->  - - W - W
- - - W -      - - - - -

Now the interesting thing happens. White move again with lower left
piece. This time it can move both left and right, but there's already
a white piece on both of these cells. But since the piece there is
with probability 1/2 and the pice that wants to move will be there
with the same probability it can move on both and we have this

- W - W -
- - - - W
- - - - -

In the top row there are two pieces -- left and right -- but noone
knows which one is where. There's even no sence is measuring a
cell, as we do know that the piece is there. But we don't know
which one.
