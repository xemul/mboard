* Shrodinger's piece

In quantum physics there's a mind experiment which intermediate
result is a cat sitting in a closed box and being simultaneously 
dead and alive. The cat's exact state can only be found out by 
unboxing it :) i.e. -- by making a measurement.

In QC we have discovered the same effect which happens when one 
player capture a peer's cell.

Consider the following situation

- B - - -        - - - - -
- - - - -  -B->  b - b - -
- W - - -        - W - - -

According to quantum rules the white player doesn't know in which
cell his opponent's piece is. Next W moves

- - - - -        - - - w -
b - b - -  -W->  b - w - - 
- W - - -        - - - - -

Since the black piece is in superposition, it may happen that black
is on the left cell and white cannot capture one and just moves on
the lower right cell. At the same time, if black piece is on the
left, white must capture one and move on the upper right cell. Both
situations' superposition is shown on the picture above.

After this the black piece is in shrodinger's cat situation -- it's
simultaneously captured and not, and its exact state can only be get
by measuring.
