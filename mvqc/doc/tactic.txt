Quantum mechanics has several interpretations that help us
understand what's going on there. In quantum checkers there
is the way to imagine what happens on the board. We call it
'multiboard playing'.

When moving a piece imagine that you're doing a simultaneous
display, but instead of making independen moves, you pick
the same piece for all the boards you play on and move it
in all the different ways.

For example, if we start with this position

- - - B -
- - - - -
- W - - -

and whites move, we can imagine two boards we play on and the
resulting positions would be these

- - - B -  - - - B -
W - - - -  - - W - -
- - - - -  - - - - -

next black move. On the first board there are two options and
on the 2nd there's only one valid move. And in the end we have
3 boards we play on.

- - - - -  - - - - -  - - - - -
W - B - -  W - - - B  - - - - -
- - - - -  - - - - -  - B - - -

Of course, sometimes some boards can go away, this happens when
measurements take place. But in the analogy we draw this means
that some opponents in the multiboard play just give up.
