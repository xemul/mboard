* Tunnel effect

In classical physics if a particle approaches a potential barrier
with the energy lower, that the barrier's it cannot pass one and
reflects backward. An example of it is a ball rolling towards a
small hill. If the kinetic enegry of the ball is small enough,
then it would roll up the hill a little bit, but then will slow
down, stop and start rolling back. Be the ball a quantum particle
there would have been a probability for it to surmount the hill
and go on moving on its opposite side without actually passing
by the hill's top.

In QC we can observe similar effect -- the position, which in
classical checkers can be played by someone to capture the peer
for sure, may result in the peer to bypass this threat.

Look at the position below.

- - B - -
- - - - -
- - - - -
- W - - -

If W moves, then in classical checkers it has a way to capture B
for sure -- just move up-right and that's it. Whatever move B
then takes it will be in a capturable position. In QC it's 
possible, that B avoids capruting and goes beyond W line.

- - B - -      - - - - -
- - - - -      - b - b -
w - w - -  ->  w - w - -
- - - - -      - - - - -

Now W can only move it being measured. Measurement can happen on
either cell white can be on -- left or right. Let's check two
possibilities.

First -- white is on the right. While B's position is not known
its exact location doesn't matter -- be it on the left or on the
right cell, white would captrure one.

- - - - -      w - - - w
- b - b -      - - - - -
- - W - -  ->  - - - - -
- - - - -      - - - - -

Now let's look at the 2nd possibility -- when W is on the left.
In this case B'l real location matters. If it's on the left cell
white would capture one and move on the top-most row, but (!) if
B is on the right white can just move one cell ahead.

- - - - -      - - w - -
- b - b -      - w - b -
W - - - -  ->  - - - - -
- - - - -      - - - - -

In this situation B is shrodinger piece, but still there's a
possibility that is survives and goes ahead. Whether or not
B has tunneled throught W will be determined after B's measurement.
